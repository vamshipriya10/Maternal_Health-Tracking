# 👩‍🍼 Maternal Health Tracking

This project focuses on tracking and analyzing key maternal health indicators to understand the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 – reducing maternal mortality to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

## 📌 Objective

To study trends in maternal health using real data and visualize changes in:

- Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)
- Antenatal Care Coverage (4+ visits)
- Skilled Birth Attendance

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Government open data (uploaded to IBM Cloud)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Features Used:**  
  - Time Period  
  - Indicator  
  - Data Value  
  - Subgroups (like Rural/Urban)

## 🔍 Visual Analysis

We used both **line charts** and **bar charts** to visualize how maternal health indicators have changed over time.

### 🔷 Line Chart Highlights

- MMR has decreased steadily from **130** to **113** per 100,000 live births between 2011–12 and 2018–19.
- ANC and Skilled Attendance show positive improvement, supporting better maternal care.

### 🔷 Bar Chart Highlights

- Bar charts clearly compare all three indicators for different years.
- Helps identify gaps between service coverage and outcome (e.g., ANC visits vs MMR drop).

## 🧠 Insights

- Consistent improvement in maternal health over the years.
- Increase in antenatal visits and skilled birth attendance contributes to declining MMR.
- A need for focused support in regions with slower improvement.

## 📈 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- IBM Watson Studio (for cloud storage and analysis)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Possible Improvements

- Add regional-level insights for deeper analysis.
- Include more indicators like adolescent birth rate or healthcare spending.
- Predict future MMR trends using ML algorithms.
